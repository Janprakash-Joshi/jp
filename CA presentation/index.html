         <h1>Cache Coherence</h1>
         <p>
            In a multiprocessor system, data inconsistency may occur among adjacent levels or within the same level of the memory hierarchy. In a shared memory multiprocessor with a separate cache memory for each processor, it is possible to have many copies of any one instruction operand: one copy in the main memory and one in each cache memory. When one copy of an operand is changed, the other copies of the operand must be changed also.

            <h1>Example : </h1>
            <p>Cache and the main memory may have inconsistent copies of the same object.</p>
            <img src="/cacheCoherenceGfGjpg.png" alt="" >
            <p>Suppose there are three processors, each having cache. Suppose the following scenario:-</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Processor 1 read X : obtains 24 from the memory and caches it.</li>
                <li>Processor 2 read X : obtains 24 from memory and caches it.</li>
                <li>Again, processor 1 writes as X : 64, Its locally cached copy is updated. Now, processor 3 reads X, what value should it get?</li>
                <li>Memory and processor 2 thinks it is 24 and processor 1 thinks it is 64.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>There are two main types of cache coherence protocols:</h1>
             <h2>1. Directory-based protocols:</h2>
             <p>This protocol uses a central directory to keep track of which processor has a copy of a memory location. When a processor modifies a location, it informs the directory and other processors are informed to invalidate their copy of that location.</p>
             <h2>2. Snooping protocols:</h2>
             <p>This protocol allows processors to snoop on the memory bus to monitor for modifications to shared locations. When a processor modifies a location, all other processors snoop the bus and invalidate their copy of that location.</p>

        <div class="slide">
          <h1>Examples of cache coherence protocols include:</h1>
          <h2>1. MSI (Modified, Shared, Invalid):</h2>
          <p>used for single-processor systems</p>
          <h2>2. MESI (Modified, Exclusive, Shared, Invalid): </h2>
          <p>used for multi-processor systems</p>
          <h2>3. MOESI (Modified, Owned, Exclusive, Shared, Invalid): </h2>
          <p>used for multi-processor systems</p>
        </div>
